  Regarding the generation, it would pick 3 random spy drill games and then assign a medal count to them.
  We don't know how either of those processes worked exactly

  # Minigame picking
  At first you would think it is random, but there seems to be a clear relation with how the games are picked.
  The algorithm seems to have a difficulty preference and it tries to increase the difficulty each time.
  It is not exactly known what algorithm is used for this, however

  # Medals Calculation
  The medals number is deterministic, meaning the same minigames always give the same medals.
  It is likely that it just follows a simple point system, but the points are likely decimal, which make it
  hard to predict their values since they would get rounded into an integer, and we lose a lot
  of information because of that
