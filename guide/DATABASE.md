# Database

Currently, all of your penguin data is stored in a folder called `data` in your Waddle Forever installation folder. In order to port your database, all you need to do is:

1. Close any instance of Waddle Forever, if it is open.
2. Copy the `data` folder from the old Waddle Forever to the new Waddle Forever installation folder. In doubt, the `data` folder should sit alongside the media folder like below

3. Open the new Waddle Forever, and the database will have been ported successfully!
