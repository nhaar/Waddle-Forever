- The Night of the living Sled 3 movie, unknown where this is from
- This file was given by Resol, but he has no clue where it was fetched from
- and the data does not match the 2009 one in the archives

- I originally thought this came from Mammoth's 2006/04 media, but the files don't match at all
- I have no idea why they are different, perhaps I changed something and I don't remember, I
- should look into the old commits at some point

- I think I roughly remember what this is, but it needs to be double checked
- I believe this is just the legacy media interface with a few patches like for allowing minigames
- to warp you to a room when it ends
- Exact modifications should be tracked down

- Telescope used in Halloween Party 2010
- No idea where I got this from, I thought it was from another party's archive, but nothing archived matched
